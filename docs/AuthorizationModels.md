# Authorization Models

Authorization models define the structure of your access control system: what types of objects exist, what relationships (like viewer or owner) they support, and how access is granted. Theyâ€™re the blueprint that tells the system how to interpret and enforce permissions.

> [!TIP]
> These examples assume you're continuing from [Getting Started](/docs/GettingStarted.md), where we set up our common imports, and initialized the SDK as `$client`.

> [!TIP]
> You'll need a store to work with authorization models. Learn how to create one in [Stores](/docs/Stores.md), and assign it's ID as `$store`.

## Transforming a DSL into an Authorization Model

```php
use OpenFGA\Models\AuthorizationModelInterface;

$dsl = <<<DSL
model
schema 1.1

type user

type domain
relations
    define member: [user]

type folder
relations
    define can_share: writer
    define owner: [user, domain#member] or owner from parent_folder
    define parent_folder: [folder]
    define viewer: [user, domain#member] or writer or viewer from parent_folder
    define writer: [user, domain#member] or owner or writer from parent_folder

type document
relations
    define can_share: writer
    define owner: [user, domain#member] or owner from parent_folder
    define parent_folder: [folder]
    define viewer: [user, domain#member] or writer or viewer from parent_folder
    define writer: [user, domain#member] or owner or writer from parent_folder
DSL;

$result = $client->dsl($dsl);

echo fold(
    $result,
    fn(AuthorizationModelInterface $model) => "DSL transformed successfully!",
    fn(Throwable $err) => "DSL transformation failed: {$err->getMessage()}"
);

failure($result, fn (Throwable $error): never => {
    // Handle transformation failure
    throw $error;
});

$model = unwrap($result);
```

## Creating an Authorization Model

```php
use OpenFGA\Responses\CreateAuthorizationModelResponseInterface;

($client->createAuthorizationModel(
    store: $store->getId(),
    typeDefinitions: $model->getTypeDefinitions(),
    conditions: $model->getConditions(),
))->onSuccess(fn(CreateAuthorizationModelResponseInterface $response) => {
    echo "Created Authorization Model ID: {$response->getModel()}\n";
});
```

## Listing Authorization Models

```php
use OpenFGA\Responses\ListAuthorizationModelsResponseInterface;

$continuationToken = null;

for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $result = $client->listAuthorizationModels(
        store: $store->getId(),
        continuationToken: $continuationToken,
    );

    success($result, fn (ListAuthorizationModelsResponseInterface $response) => {
        foreach ($response->getModels() as $model) {
            echo "Authorization Model ID: {$model->getId()}\n";
        }

        $continuationToken = $response->getContinuationToken();
    });

    if (failure($result) || $continuationToken === null) {
        break;
    }
}
```

- The `continuationToken` parameter is only necessary when paginating results.
- The `pageSize` parameter controls the number of models returned per pagination request.

## Getting an Authorization Model

```php
use OpenFGA\Responses\GetAuthorizationModelResponseInterface;

$result = $client->getAuthorizationModel(
    store: $store->getId(),
    model: $model->getId()
);

success($result, fn(GetAuthorizationModelResponseInterface $response) => {
    $model = $response->getModel();

    echo "Authorization Model ID: {$model->getId()}\n\n";

    // Transform the AuthorizationModel into a DSL string with `AuthorizationModel::dsl()`.
    echo "Authorization Model DSL:\n\n{$model->dsl()}\n";
});
```

## Next Steps

1. **Next, you'll need to [create some relationship tuples](/docs/RelationshipTuples.md).**

- With relationship tuples in place, you can then [query](/docs/Queries.md) for specific users' access to certain resources, based on your authorization model.

- It's also a good idea to create [assertions](/docs/Assertions.md) to validate that your access rules behave as expected and catch mistakes early.
