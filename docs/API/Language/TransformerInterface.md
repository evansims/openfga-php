# TransformerInterface

OpenFGA DSL Transformer Interface for authorization model conversions. This interface defines methods for converting between OpenFGA&#039;s Domain Specific Language (DSL) format and structured authorization model objects. The DSL provides a human-readable way to define authorization relationships and permissions that can be easily reviewed, edited, and version controlled. The transformer supports bidirectional conversion, allowing models to be defined in DSL format and then converted to API objects, or existing models to be exported back to DSL format for documentation and review purposes.
