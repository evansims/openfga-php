# TranslatorInterface

Translation service interface for OpenFGA SDK messages. This interface defines the contract for a centralized message translation system that supports parameterized messages, multiple locales, and integration with the OpenFGA SDK&#039;s error handling and user-facing messaging systems. The translator is designed to work with the Messages enum for type-safe message references and supports dynamic parameter substitution for contextual error messages and user notifications.
