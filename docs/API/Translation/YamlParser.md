# YamlParser

Simple YAML parser for translation files. This lightweight YAML parser handles the specific structure used by OpenFGA translation files. It supports basic key-value pairs, nested structures, and simple comments. It does not support advanced YAML features like anchors, references, or complex data types. The parser is optimized for the simple, flat-ish structure of translation files and provides better performance than a full YAML library for this specific use case.
