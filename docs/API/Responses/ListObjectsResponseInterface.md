# ListObjectsResponseInterface

Interface for object listing response objects. This interface defines the contract for responses returned when listing objects that a user has access to in OpenFGA. This is the inverse of permission checking - instead of asking &quot;can this user access this object?,&quot; it asks &quot;what objects can this user access?&quot; Object listing is particularly useful for building user interfaces that need to display only the resources a user can access, such as file listings, document repositories, or administrative dashboards.
