# ExpandResponseInterface

Interface for relationship expansion response objects. This interface defines the contract for responses returned when expanding relationships in OpenFGA. An expand response contains a tree structure that shows all the users and usersets that have a particular relationship with an object, providing a comprehensive view of the authorization graph. Relationship expansion is useful for understanding complex authorization structures, debugging permission issues, and visualizing how relationships are resolved.
