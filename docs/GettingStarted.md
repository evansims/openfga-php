# Getting Started

1. **Prepare an OpenFGA instance**.

   Either [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fine-grained-authorization) (managed) or [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/) (self-hosted) are supported.

   [Docker](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/docker) is the quickest way to get up and running for local development.

   ```bash
   docker pull openfga/openfga
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name openfga openfga/openfga
   ```

2. **Install the SDK** using Composer.

   ```bash
   composer require evansims/openfga-php
   ```

   Please ensure your project has the [required dependencies](/README.md#requirements) installed.

3. **Create a client**.

   ```php
   use OpenFGA\Client;

   use function OpenFGA\Results\{fold, success, failure, unwrap};

   $client = new Client(url: 'http://localhost:8080');
   ```

   No authentication is used by default, but [pre-shared keys](/docs/Authentication.md#pre-shared-keys) and [client credentials](/docs/Authentication.md#client-credentials) are supported.

## Next Steps

1. **First, you'll need to [create a store](/docs/Stores.md).** Stores are isolated environments that contain their own authorization model and data, allowing you to manage permissions separately for different applications, tenants, or environments.

2. **Then, you'll need to [create an authorization model](/docs/AuthorizationModels.md).** Models define the structure of your access control system: what types of objects exist, what relationships (like viewer or owner) they support, and how access is granted. Theyâ€™re the blueprint that tells the system how to interpret and enforce permissions.

3. **Next, you'll need to [create some relationship tuples](/docs/RelationshipTuples.md).** Tuples are the building blocks of authorization. They represent the actual permissions granted to users or groups for specific objects.

- With relationship tuples in place, you can then [query](/docs/Queries.md) for specific users' access to certain resources, based on your authorization model.

- It's also a good idea to create [assertions](/docs/Assertions.md) to validate that your access rules behave as expected and catch mistakes early.
