# Assertions

Assertions are test cases that check whether specific users should or shouldnâ€™t have access to certain resources, based on your authorization model. They help you validate that your access rules behave as expected and catch mistakes early.

> [!TIP]
> These examples assume you're continuing from [Getting Started](/docs/GettingStarted.md), where we set up our common imports, and initialized the SDK as `$client`.

> [!TIP]
> You'll need a store and an authorization model to work with assertions. Learn how to create a store in [Stores](/docs/Stores.md), and assign it's ID as `$store`. Then, learn how to create an authorization model in [Authorization Models](/docs/AuthorizationModels.md), and assign it's ID as `$model`.

**Read assertions** with `Client::readAssertions()`:

```php
use OpenFGA\Responses\ReadAssertionsResponseInterface;

$result = $client->readAssertions(
    store: $store->getId(),
    model: $model->getId(),
);

success($result, fn(ReadAssertionsResponseInterface $response) => {
    foreach ($response->getAssertions() as $assertion) {
        echo "Assertion: {$assertion->getAssertion()} {$assertion->getRelation()} {$assertion->getObject()}\n";
    }
});
```

**Write assertions** with `Client::writeAssertions()`:

```php
use OpenFGA\Responses\WriteAssertionsResponseInterface;
use OpenFGA\Models\{Assertion, TupleKey};
use OpenFGA\Collections\Assertions;

$assertions = new Assertions([
    new Assertion(
        tupleKey: new TupleKey(
            user: 'user:anne',
            relation: 'reader',
            object: 'document:roadmap',
        ),
        expectation: true,
    ),
]);

$result = $client->writeAssertions(
    store: $store->getId(),
    model: $model->getId(),
    assertions: $assertions,
);

success($result, fn(WriteAssertionsResponseInterface $response) => {
    foreach ($response->getAssertions() as $assertion) {
        echo "Assertion: {$assertion->getAssertion()} {$assertion->getRelation()} {$assertion->getObject()}\n";
    }
});
```
