**Authorization models are your permission blueprint.** They define what types of things exist in your system and how they relate to each other. Think database schema, but for permissions.

## Prerequisites

The examples in this guide assume you have the following setup:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-setup.php)

## Building your first model

Let's jump right into building a document sharing system. Here's what we want:

- Users can own, edit, or view documents
- Owners can do everything
- Editors can edit and view
- Viewers can only view

We'll define this model using OpenFGA's [DSL](https://openfga.dev/docs/configuration-language) format:

```yaml
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user] or owner
    define viewer: [user] or editor
```

The `or` keyword creates inheritance - owners automatically become editors, and editors automatically become viewers.

## Creating your model

Use the SDK's `dsl` [helper](../Features/Helpers.md) to create a model, then use the `model` [helper](../Features/Helpers.md) to commit the model to the OpenFGA server:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-dsl.php#dsl)

Save that returned `$modelId`â€”you'll need it for future API calls.

## Common patterns

### Direct assignment

The simplest relationship - a user directly has a role:

```yaml
type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
```

This lets you write tuples like `user:alice owner document:readme`.

### Computed relations

Relations that inherit from other relations:

```yaml
type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: owner  // All owners are editors
    define viewer: editor // All editors are viewers
```

### Union relations

Multiple ways to get the same permission:

```yaml
type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user] or owner     // Direct editors OR owners
    define viewer: [user] or editor    // Direct viewers OR editors
```

### Hierarchical permissions

Inherit permissions from parent objects:

```yaml
type folder
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define viewer: [user] or owner

type document
  relations
    define parent: [folder]
    define owner: [user]
    define viewer: [user] or owner or viewer from parent
```

Now documents inherit viewer permissions from their parent folder.

### Group membership

Users belong to groups, groups have permissions:

```yaml
type user

type group
  relations
    define member: [user]

type document
  relations
    define owner: [user, group#member]
    define viewer: [user, group#member] or owner
```

The `group#member` syntax means "users who are members of the group."

## Working with conditions

Add context-aware permissions using conditions:

```yaml
type document
  relations
    define viewer: [user with valid_ip]
    define editor: [user with business_hours]
```

Define conditions when creating your model:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-conditions.php#conditions)

## Using models in your application

### Check permissions

The `allowed` [helper](../Features/Helpers.md#checking-permissions) provides a convenient shorthand for checking permissions, and returns a boolean:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-permissions.php#allowed)

If you need greater control over the operation, use the Client `check` method directly:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-permissions.php#client)

### List user's objects

The `objects` [helper](../Features/Helpers.md) provides a convenient shorthand for listing user's objects, and returns an array of object identifiers:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-list-objects.php#helper)

If you need greater control over the operation, use the Client `streamedListObjects` or `listObjects` methods directly:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-list-objects.php#client)

## Advanced patterns

### Multi-tenant systems

Each tenant has their own workspace:

```yaml
type user

type tenant
  relations
    define member: [user]
    define admin: [user]

type document
  relations
    define tenant: [tenant]
    define owner: [user] and member from tenant
    define viewer: [user] and member from tenant
```

The `and` keyword requires both conditions - users must be both assigned the role AND be members of the tenant.

### Approval workflows

Documents need approval before publishing:

```yaml
type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define editor: [user] or owner
    define approver: [user]
    define can_publish: approver and owner
    define viewer: [user] or can_publish
```

### Time-based access

```yaml
type document
  relations
    define owner: [user]
    define viewer: [user with during_work_hours] or owner
```

### Nested resources

Permissions flow down through resource hierarchies:

```yaml
type organization
  relations
    define admin: [user]
    define member: [user] or admin

type project
  relations
    define organization: [organization]
    define admin: [user] or admin from organization
    define member: [user] or member from organization

type document
  relations
    define project: [project]
    define editor: [user] or admin from project
    define viewer: [user] or member from project
```

## Managing models

### List all models

The `models` helper provides a convenient, self-paginated method for retrieving all the authorization models in a store:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-list-all.php#helper)

Alternatively you can call the Client `listAuthorizationModels` method directly:

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-list-all.php#client)

### Get a specific model

[Snippet](../../examples/snippets/models-list-all.php#specific)

## Troubleshooting common issues

### "My permissions aren't working as expected"

- Use [`expand()`](Queries.md) to see the permission tree
- Check if you're using the correct model ID in your checks
- Verify your authorization model DSL syntax

### "Users have too many permissions"

- Check for unintended `or` relationships in your model
- Review inheritance patterns - owners might inherit editor/viewer permissions
- Use [assertions](Assertions.md) to test expected vs actual permissions

### "Users don't have enough permissions"

- Verify relationships are written correctly as [tuples](Tuples.md)
- Check if you're [querying](Queries.md) with the right object/relation names
- Use [`readTuples()`](Tuples.md#reading-existing-permissions) to see what permissions exist

## What's next

Once you've created your authorization model, it's crucial to test it thoroughly. The [Assertions guide](Assertions.md) shows you how to write comprehensive tests for your authorization models, ensuring they behave exactly as expected before deploying to production.
