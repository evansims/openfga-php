**The OpenFGA PHP SDK puts relationship-based access control at your fingertips.** Describe ‚Äúwho can do what‚Äù once in a human-friendly DSL, then let [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/) or [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fga) enforce it. No scattering of `if` statements across your codebase or brittle policy files. A fluent API with strict typing, and PSR-compatible networking makes all the plumbing disappear, unburdening you with cleaner code, sharper security boundaries, and room to grow.

**Quick Navigation:** [‚ö° Installation](#installation) ‚Ä¢ [üöÄ Quick Start](#quick-start) ‚Ä¢ [üìö Full Documentation](docs/GettingStarted.md) ‚Ä¢ [üîß API Reference](docs/API)

## Highlights

- **Strictly-typed API** ‚Äî Native type hinting and linter-friendly generics catch errors before they reach production
- **Standards first** ‚Äî Built for interoperability with any PSR-compatible HTTP library you prefer
- **Human-friendly DSL** ‚Äî Parse and commit authorization model changes using plain text instead of complex JSON
- **Ready to scale** ‚Äî One solution from weekend projects to enterprise apps with millions of tuples
- **Community-maintained** ‚Äî Stewarded by seasoned PHP contributors; dedicated to stability and security
- **Battle-tested** ‚Äî Comprehensive test coverage and used in production by teams worldwide

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- Composer
- [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/) or [Auth0 FGA](https://auth0.com/fga)
- PSR-7, PSR-17, and PSR-18 networking libraries

## Installation

Install the SDK via Composer:

```bash
composer require evansims/openfga-php
```

You'll also need PSR-7, PSR-17, and PSR-18 implementations. Any PSR-compatible networking libraries will work. The SDK adapts to whatever you're already using, so choose what works best for your project.

## Quick Start

Ready to see it in action? This 5-minute example shows you the complete flow: setup ‚Üí define permissions ‚Üí check access.

**What you'll build:** A simple document system where users can be viewers or editors.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use OpenFGA\Client;
use OpenFGA\Models\AuthorizationModel;
use OpenFGA\Responses\{
    CreateStoreResponseInterface,
    CreateAuthorizationModelResponseInterface,
    CheckResponseInterface
};

use function OpenFGA\Models\{tuple, tuples};

define('STORE_NAME', 'my-php-store');

// 1. Initialize the SDK Client

$client = new Client(
    url: 'http://localhost:8080',
);

// 2. Create a Store

$store = ($client->createStore(name: STORE_NAME))
    ->then(fn(CreateStoreResponseInterface $store) => $store->getId())
    ->success(fn($id) => print "Store created! ID: {$id}\n")
    ->unwrap();

// 3. Create an Authorization Model from a DSL

$dsl = <<<DSL
    model
        schema 1.1

    type user

    type document
        relations
        define viewer: [user]
DSL;

$model = ($client->dsl($dsl))
    ->then(fn(AuthorizationModel $model) => $client->createAuthorizationModel(
        store: $store,
        typeDefinitions: $model->getTypeDefinitions(),
        conditions: $model->getConditions(),
    ))
    ->then(fn(CreateAuthorizationModelResponseInterface $model) => $model->getModel())
    ->success(fn($id) => print "Authorization Model created! ID: {$id}\n")
    ->unwrap();

// 4. Write a Relationship Tuple

$tuple = tuple(
    user: 'user:anne',
    relation: 'viewer',
    object: 'document:roadmap',
);

$client->writeTuples(store: $store, model: $model, writes: tuples($tuple))
    ->success(fn() => print "Anne can now view the roadmap document\n");

// 5. Perform an Authorization Check

$allowed = $client->check(store: $store, model: $model, tupleKey: $tuple)
    ->unwrap(fn(CheckResponseInterface $response) => $response->getAllowed());

match ($allowed) {
    true => print "SUCCESS: Anne CAN view the roadmap!\n",
    false => print "FAILURE: Anne CANNOT view the roadmap.\n",
};

// For a more detailed walkthrough, see docs/GettingStarted.md
```

For robust error handling, explore the `Success`/`Failure` patterns described in [Error Handling and Results](docs/Results.md).

## Core Concepts

The SDK provides a fluent interface for interacting with all the core features of OpenFGA. Here's a brief overview:

- **[Stores](docs/Stores.md):** Isolated environments for your authorization models and relationship data. They allow you to manage permissions separately for different applications or tenants.

- **[Authorization Models](docs/AuthorizationModels.md):** These define the structure of your access control system ‚Äì the types of objects, the possible relationships (e.g., `viewer`, `editor`), and how those relationships grant permissions. You can define models using a human-readable DSL.

- **[Relationship Tuples](docs/RelationshipTuples.md):** These are what define **who** has **what** relationship with **which** object (e.g., "user:anne is a `viewer` of document:roadmap"). You can write, read, and delete these tuples.

- **[Queries](docs/Queries.md):** Ask powerful questions about your authorization data:

  - `check()`: "Does this user have this permission on this object?"
  - `expand()`: "How does this user have this permission?"
  - `listUsers()`: "Which users have this permission on this object?"
  - `listObjects()`: "Which objects of a certain type can this user access with this permission?"

- **[Assertions](docs/Assertions.md):** These are used for testing your authorization models. You can assert whether specific relationships should exist or not, helping you verify your model's correctness.

## Authentication

Secure your connection to OpenFGA with any supported authentication method:

- **üîì No authentication** ‚Äî Perfect for local development and testing
- **üîë API Token** ‚Äî Simple pre-shared key authentication for internal services
- **üõ°Ô∏è OAuth2 Client Credentials** ‚Äî Enterprise-grade security for production (Auth0 FGA, etc.)

**Quick Setup:**

```php
// For production with Auth0 FGA
$client = new Client(
    url: 'https://api.us1.fga.dev',
    authentication: Authentication::CLIENT_CREDENTIALS,
    clientId: $_ENV['FGA_CLIENT_ID'],
    clientSecret: $_ENV['FGA_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    issuer: $_ENV['FGA_ISSUER'],
    audience: $_ENV['FGA_AUDIENCE']
);
```

## Error Handling and Results

Client methods return `Result` objects representing either a `Success` or a `Failure` outcome. This pattern allows for explicit error handling. Helper functions like `unwrap()`, `success()`, and `failure()` are provided to simplify working with these results.
