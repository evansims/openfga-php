# TODO

The following are my long term goals for this project, in no particular order:

- CI monitoring of OpenFGA's OpenAPI definitions to track upstream changes and plan SDK updates.
- Improve API documentation.
- Add additional examples.

Extend the SDK with integrations for other frameworks:

1. Laravel package 💯
2. Symfony bundle 👍
3. WordPress plugin? 🤔
